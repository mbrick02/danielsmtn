Attached are invitation .jpg files for this year.  Email back if you can make it.  There is no need to respond if you can’t make it, but keep the Usufruct in mind if you will be near southwestern Virginia the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.

If I have not let you know about the Usufruct before, you may find an explanation at the bottom of this message.

Usufruct Description: My Uncle, who passed away a number of years back, began a tradition of gathering family and friends on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.  He titled the gathering "The Usufruct" (having to  do with the legal term which has something to do with having the rights to the fruit of the land without owning the land -- he was caretaker for the family land, Daniel's Mountain where I now reside).  Despite the name, it is an extremely informal gathering.  My uncle would roast a pig, play bagpipes, and recite Shakespeare -- most years even mounting a full production (with uneven success) by the Daniel's Mountain Players.  We are keeping this tradition alive, as best we can, with a barbeque and some music and some Shakespeare.  Again, it is very informal.  Feel free to come with your family if you have the day available for the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend.  As the announcement says, there is no need to reply if you cannot make it.  If you can attend let me know, and I will email you directions and more info.</p></div></td>
