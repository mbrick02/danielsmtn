<h1>What is "The Usufruct"?</h1>  
<p>The Usufruct is our, very informal, annual family and friends gathering 
that my Uncle Donald started many years back.  
He was the caretaker of our family land, Daniel's Mountain, before he passed 
away a few years back--the family land dates back to my great-grandfather being born a 
slave on the property; which he and his brother, Daniel, eventually purchased after the Civil War. 
My uncle called the party The “Usufruct”, because that was a legal term that he explained meant 
“the rights to the fruit of the land without owning the land” (he had a legal degree).  
His tradition was to mount a Shakespeare production, play the bagpipes, roast a pig along with 
having other entertainment and food.  I keep the Shakespeare tradition alive by performing 
a monologue—not a full production.  Other performers round out the entertainment.</p>
